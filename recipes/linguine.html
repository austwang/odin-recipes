                <li>3 pounds littleneck clams, scrubbed</li>
                <li>8 garlic cloves, divided</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
                <li>3/4 cup plain panko bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup, plus 2 tablespoons, Extra Virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
                <li>3 oil-packed anchovy fillets</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>1/2 cup clam juice</li>
                <li>12 ounces linguini</li>
                <li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped, divided</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large stock pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, mince 3 of the garlic cloves and set aside.</li>
                <li>Using a Dutch oven add 1 tablespoon butter and place over medium-high heat. When the butter is melted, add the bread crumbs and toast, stirring frequently until lightly golden, about 1-2 minutes. turn off the heat and add the minced garlic, lemon zest and parsley. Place in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Rinse out the Dutch oven and set aside. Using a parking knife, thinly slice the remaining 6 cloves of garlic. Place the Dutch oven back over a medium flame. Add the 1/4 cup olive oil and when hot, but not smoking, add the garlic and cook until fragrant and slightly golden, about 2 minutes. Add the anchovies and red pepper flakes, if using. Cook until the anchovies begin to break apart. Add the wine and simmer. Reduce the mixture by 1/2. Add the clams, stir well, cover and cook unto the clams open about 6 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the clams to a medium mixing bowl and cover with aluminum foil. Set aside.</li>
                <li>By this point your water should be boiling, Add the linguini and cook till al dente, about 6 minutes. Do not drain the paste, reserve about 1 cup (or more) of pasta water. Using tongs, transfer the linguini directly to the Dutch oven with the clam liquid. Add 1/2 cup of the pasta water and clam juice and bring to a boil. Cook while stirring constantly reducing the liquid by 1/2 and until the sauce has thickened somewhat and is coating the linguini nicely, about 5 minutes. (Note: more pasta water can be added if need just do so in small amounts and readjust the seasoning to taste).</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining parsley and 1 tablespoon butter. Add about 1/3 of the toasted bread crumb mixture to the linguini and mix well to combine.</li>
                <li>To serve, divide the linguini among serving bowls, top with clams, sprinkle more bread-crumb mixture on top and drizzle lightly with olive oil.</li>
            </ol>
